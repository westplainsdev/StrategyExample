## To run the application

This application was built on DotNet Core 3.1 and uses nothing more than just `System` references so you should be good
to run this application on Dotnet Frameworks higher than Core 3.1.1. If you're wanting to run this application on a 
different version of the DotNet framework you will need to modify or remove the `StrategyExamle.csproj` file. 

You should be able to download or fork this repository and run the application via Visual Studio, VS Code or using a non-Microsoft tool such as JetBrains Rider.
